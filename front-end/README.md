# Miracle Messages
Did you know that many homeless people are considered a missing person by their family? Their families are searching for them but have no way to contact or find them. Join Miracle Messages in their mission to help reconnect a person experiencing homelessness with their loved ones. Volunteers create a case for a homeless person they meet on the streets that is looking to find their family. People can also use the tool to post their missing family member or friend.
